# Sprint

- implement translations
- implement symmetries (flips)

# Backlog

- there are too many places where we manipulate 4 things for instances of SampleInputTokens (they have different learned embedding)
- add class QLearningState
- add class QLearningActionValue

- implement rotations

- use "Feed forward mechanisms" from xformers
- use "Residual paths" from xformers
- add class add class Experience with (s, a, r, s')
