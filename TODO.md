# Sprint

- add counter in input.
- find out why there are peaks in the loss curve here:

- check if the auto-regressive inference AI is able to predict the output for the train examples
 to check if model generalizes well for a known puzzle
- do a code review of all the source code

# Backlog

- investigate model inference predicted action value using the function print_inferred_action_value.


- generate action_examples once and write them to disk

- add class QLearningState
- add class QLearningActionValue

- implement translations
- implement rotations

- use "Feed forward mechanisms" from xformers
- use "Residual paths" from xformers
- add class add class Experience with (s, a, r, s')

- check if the auto-regressive inference AI is able to predict the output for the test example.
