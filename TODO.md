# Sprint

- use neural network to generate random games

- don't assume perfect play to compute future rewards
- use AROUND_ACTION_CHAR = ','
- don't pass the AROUND_ACTION_CHAR chars to the neural network

# Backlog

- move functions that load json files to puzzle_data.py
- move norm and dropout at same scope in transformer block
- increase dropout

- reduce number of train steps
- reduce batch size

- use half precision float16
